# CV Generator

This project is a **CV Generator** built using **React**, designed to help users quickly create and format their resumes. It was developed as part of **The Odin Project**, where I explored and implemented **React states**, gaining a deeper understanding of their role in managing dynamic and interactive components.

## What I Learned

This project was an opportunity to:

- **Understand and implement React states**: Learned how to use `useState` for handling user inputs and dynamically updating the CV preview.
- **Component-based architecture**: Designed reusable components for different sections of the CV.
- **Data flow in React**: Managed parent-child data flow and ensured seamless updates across components.
- **Styling in React**: Improved skills in using CSS modules and inline styling techniques for React.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Used conditions to dynamically render sections based on user inputs.
